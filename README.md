![Logo Placeholder](https://github.com/CptGummiball/Ducks/blob/main/logo.png)

Welcome to **Ducks**, a quirky incremental idle game where you hatch ducks, send them on daring raids, and collect bread crumbs to upgrade your duck-hatching facilities. Watch your duck empire grow as you unlock new, humorous units and facilities, and prepare for future global events!

## **Gameplay Overview**

In **Ducks**, your goal is to manage and expand your duck production by hatching various types of ducks and sending them on raids to collect bread crumbs. These crumbs can be used to unlock and upgrade new facilities, each producing different types of ducks that contribute to your success.

### **Main Features:**
- **Duck Hatching & Raids:** Hatch ducks in specialized facilities and send them on raids to collect bread crumbs. While ducks are lost in raids, your facilities and upgrades remain intact.
- **Bread Crumbs:** The in-game currency used to unlock and upgrade duck-producing facilities, allowing for faster and more efficient duck production.
- **Multiple Hilarious Facilities:** Unlock a variety of fun and creative duck-producing facilities, each with unique units:
  - **Hatchery**: Produces basic ducks.
  - **Large Nest**: Produces heavy ducks.
  - **Cloud Nest**: Sky ducks that boost the efficiency of other facilities.
  - **Golden Pond**: Rare golden ducks that generate higher bread crumb rewards.
  - And many more to discover!
  
### **Planned Features:**
- **Funny, Cartoonish Graphics:** The game will feature playful and colorful graphics, bringing each facility and duck type to life with a humorous, lighthearted style.
- **Global Raids (Future):** Weekly global raids where players combine their ducks for massive rewards. Players will be rewarded based on their total contribution, with the chance to earn a 200% bread crumb bonus.
- **Online World Map (Future):** A global map showing duck production stats by country, allowing players to see where they rank in duck production.
- **Cloud Save (Future):** Secure your progress in the cloud and sync your game across multiple devices with future cloud storage support.

These online features will be implemented in the final production phases.

## **Development Status**

**Ducks** is currently in active development. The game mechanics are being polished, and additional features such as global raids, online world maps, and cloud saving will be added later in the production cycle.
